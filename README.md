# DIRECTORY
 on ponytown, our display names follow a name ; prn ; int status ; sys ; emote format. depending on the fronter, some parts may be omitted, but emote is not -- that's how you can tell who's on. this is a quick, constantly updated guide -- once an alter chooses an emoji, it will be added.

ðŸ“Œ / thumbtack - halcifer (or, whatever display name on the pony) -- it/its, wire/wires/wirefrag or whatever is in the display name. will not initate conversation, may hover awkwardly.

 ðŸ’Œ / love letter - rowwyn ampora -- he/him. not an eridan or cronus, please do not call him such. omits o for *. permanently int with care, might initiate, will not seek you out actively unless invited.
