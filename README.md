# DIRECTORY
on ponytown, our display names follow one of two formats:
<p> 
name ; prn ; int status ; sys ; emote format for alters using skins of their source, </p>
<p>or name ; prn ; misc tag ; emote for when we're using a cos/comfort/etc.</p>
depending on the fronter, some parts may be omitted, but emote will never be -- that's how you can tell who's on. 
this is a constantly updated guide -- once an alter chooses an emoji, it will be added. typing quirks are also listed, if any.

<p>ðŸ“Œ / thumbtack - halcifer (or, whatever display name on the pony) -- it/its, wire/wires/wirefrag or whatever is in the display name. will not initate conversation, may hover awkwardly. dirk/hal format or dave format.</p>

â™Šâ™‹ / cancer+gemini - tulpon captor-vantas -- any/all. neutral on interaction; won't actively seek anyone out but is fine being spoken to. lowerca6e+punctuation+some mi6pelling6, s -> 6

<p>ðŸ‘» / ghost - Cerebrum, Beedee, or Brain Ghost Dirk -- he/him, testing she/her. Won't interact first, but all interaction is welcome. Will probably sit next to you. Dirk format. </p>

#TT - we're attempting to pass as a singlet, or the host felt like busting out the sona. or either. interact if you'd like, no promise we will reciprocate.
