# DIRECTORY
 on ponytown, our display names follow a name ; prn ; int status ; sys ; emote format. depending on the fronter, some parts may be omitted, but emote is not -- that's how you can tell who's on. this is a quick, constantly updated guide -- once an alter chooses an emoji, it will be added. typing quirks are also listed if any.

ðŸ“Œ / thumbtack - halcifer (or, whatever display name on the pony) -- it/its, wire/wires/wirefrag or whatever is in the display name. will not initate conversation, may hover awkwardly. dirk/hal format or dave format.

 â™Šâ™‹ / cancer+gemini - tulpon captor-vantas -- any/all. neutral on interaction; won't actively seek anyone out but is fine being spoken to. s -> 6
